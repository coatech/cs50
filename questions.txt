1.  What’s stdint.h?
	ANSWER::
			stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write 
			more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and 
			maximum allowable values for each type, using macros .


2.	What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
	ANSWER::
			If you require that an integer be represented in exactly N bits
	
3.	How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
	ANSWER::
			BYTE  = 1 bytes
			WORD  = 2 bytes
			DWORD = 4 bytes
			LONG  = 8 bytes
	
4.	What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats 
	(with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
	ANSWER::
			bfType

5.	What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
	ANSWER::
			biSize = The number of bytes required by the structure. The size, in bytes, of the image.
			bfSize = biSizeImage + sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) + sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER)
			
6.	What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
	ANSWER::
			 If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
	
7.	What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
	ANSWER::
			It is the biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure that determines the number of bits which define each pixel and the maximum number of 
			colors in the bitmap.
			
8.	Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
	ANSWER::
			It means that the file might not exist or some permission error occurred while accessing a file such as "Read-Only" or "Write-Protected", 
			so in those cases fopen will return 0 (a NULL pointer).
			
9.	Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
	ANSWER::
			It may be because the program is reading the bitmap image RGBtriple one per for loop

10.	What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3
	ANSWER::
			from the workthrough with zamyla the line 65 assign the value 3 to padding if bi.biWidth is 3
			
11.	What does fseek do?
	ANSWER::
			fseek - sets file position
			
12.	What is SEEK_CUR?
	ANSWER::		
			SEEK_CUR. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko functions, specifies that the 
			offset provided is relative to the current file position.
